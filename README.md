## Description :newspaper:
This repository shows my first steps on `Game Development`, some of the progress I have made; and goals I have acomplished with this `Game Engine`

- `Game Development` is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a game. It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is important to think about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.
- `Unity Game Engine` is a 3D/2D game engine and powerful cross-platform IDE for developers. As a game engine, Unity is able to provide many of the most important built-in features that make a game work.
